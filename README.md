# JavascriptPromises-AsynchronousCode

Let’s have some fun working with callbacks and promises! You’ll complete these exercises twice, using two different methods. 
First, you’ll use promises! Then, in the exercises at the end of the next subunit, you’ll use ***async*** / ***await***!

If this is your first time seeing these challenges, start by solving them with promises.
Once you’ve solved this using promises continue to the next subunit and after learning about async functions solve these using async and await.
